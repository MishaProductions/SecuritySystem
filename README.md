# MHS - Mikhail Home Security

This is the source code that I use for my DIY Security system in my home. 

## Background
My home had an ADT BHS-4000 system originally.

(Sorry for horrible camera quality)

This system still had its original sensors and everything, it was just simply unplugged. Around 2022, I replaced the main board with an Orange PI PC+, and that's when this project began. The window sensors simply pass through power when they are closed, and vice versa.

I bought a simple GPIO breakout board, and connected all of the sensors to there.
